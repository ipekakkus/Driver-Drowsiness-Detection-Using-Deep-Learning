## **Driver Drowsiness Detection Using Deep Learning**

This project focuses on developing a robust driver drowsiness detection system using state-of-the-art deep learning models. The goal is to identify drowsy vs non-drowsy driver states from facial images, evaluate model performance across datasets, and analyze generalization capability beyond a single environment.

🚗 **Project Overview**

Drowsy driving is a major cause of traffic accidents worldwide. The purpose of this project is to design and evaluate a vision-based detection system that can reliably determine whether a driver is drowsy in real time.

The project:
- Implements and trains multiple deep learning architectures
- Performs extensive performance evaluation
- Tests cross-dataset generalization
- Benchmarks inference speed and model efficiency
- Provides comparison visualizations and analysis
- All experiments, models, evaluation scripts, and dataset handling pipelines are included.

**Models Implemented & Compared**

The following CNN architectures were trained and evaluated:
- ResNet50V2
- MobileNetV2
- EfficientNetB0
- NASNetMobile

Each model was:
- fine-tuned on the NTHU-DDD dataset
- evaluated on both NTHU-DDD test split and full DDD dataset
- compared using multiple metrics and generalization plots

**Datasets Used**
1. NTHU-DDD (NTHU Driver Drowsiness Detection Dataset)
   Used for training, validation, and in-distribution testing.

2. DDD (Driver Drowsiness Dataset)
  Used for cross-dataset generalization experiments.
  Contains 41,000+ labeled images categorized into:
      - Drowsy
      - Non Drowsy
    
This dataset helps test whether a model trained on NTHU-DDD generalizes to a different environment, lighting condition, and subject pool.

📊 **Evaluation Metrics**

Each model is evaluated on:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- AUC (ROC-AUC)

Additionally, the project includes:

- Confusion Matrices
- ROC Curves
- Side-by-side metric comparisons
- Generalization drop charts (Δ between datasets)
- Multi-metric summary visualizations
- Inference speed (images/sec)
- Total evaluation time per model
